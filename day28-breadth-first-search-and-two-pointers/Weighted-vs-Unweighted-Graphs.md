# The differences between weighted and unweighted graphs.

A **graph** in computer science is a data structure that consists of a set of vertices (or nodes) and a set of edges. Each edge connects a pair of vertices. Graphs can be used to represent many different things, such as social networks, web pages, routes, etc.

Now, let's talk about the difference between weighted and unweighted graphs.

### Unweighted Graphs

An **unweighted graph** is a graph in which all edges are of equal "weight" or "cost". This essentially means that moving from one vertex to another always costs the same, regardless of the edge that you're traversing. When you're trying to find the shortest path between two nodes in an unweighted graph, you're actually trying to find the path that involves the smallest number of edges.

### Weighted Graphs

On the other hand, a **weighted graph** is a graph in which each edge carries a certain weight or cost. The weight could represent various things depending on the problem at hand, such as distance between two places, cost of a transaction, time taken from moving from one place to another, etc. In weighted graphs, the shortest path may not involve the smallest number of edges, as it depends on the weights of the edges. Algorithms like Dijkstra's or Bellman-Ford's are used for finding shortest paths in weighted graphs.

Here is a simple ASCII representation of an unweighted and a weighted graph:

Unweighted Graph:
```
A -- B
| \  |
|  \ |
C -- D
```

Weighted Graph:
```
 A --3-- B
 | \     |
 4  2    1
 |     \ |
 C --5-- D
```
In the unweighted graph, you don't see any numbers on the edges, because the cost to go from one vertex to another is the same. In the weighted graph, each edge has a number that represents the weight (or cost) of traversing that edge.

I hope this clarifies the difference between weighted and unweighted graphs! If you have any more questions, feel free to ask.
