# Day 13 React Router & Client Side Routing in a SPA

Today, we'll be going through part of [the official tutorial on React Router](https://reactrouter.com/en/main/start/tutorial). My approach to integrating Client Side Routing into the Job Application Tracker is to first do the tutorial that explains how to work with the newest version of React Router DOM and then to compare the application in the tutorial to my application in order to apply my knowledge of the patterns explained in the tutorial to my partricular application. Because you all will be building different applications for your projects over these couple of weeks, I wanted to go through this tutorial with you all together and you can then refer back to the changes that I make to the Job Application Tracker and use those as an example for your own projects.
